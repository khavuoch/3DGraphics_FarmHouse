### DESCRIPTION

The Farm House project is the combination of 3D modeling and a simulation. The project will create a 3D world the contains 3D models of buildings, animals, and plants. The scene will be located in a farmland but the building will be a modern house. The house will allow the user to enter and move around the first and second floor. The inside of the house will contain 3D models of furnitures that allow users to interact with the door and faucet. 
On the outside, there will be a farmland and fields that contain animals, trees and crops. 3D models of animals such as a cow, chicken, and pig will roam the field. On the farmland, there will also be crops such as a rice paddy and trees. There is also mountains in the background.


### FEATURES

#### Implemented Functional Requirements
The user shall be able to walk around in the scene.
The user shall be able to walk into the house.
The user shall be able to press WASD keys or arrow keys on the keyboard to move along the screen
The user shall be able to jump with space key
The user shall be able to move the mouse in the direction the user wants to turn towards
The user shall be able to interact with doors and water taps in the house with the left mouse click
The simulation shall show 3D images of animals, plants, and buildings
The simulation shall show animated objects such animals moving and doors opening/closing
The simulation shall show gravity and water effects
The simulation shall show day and night cycle
The simulation showcases wind effect 

#### Non-functional Requirements
*Correctness*

All inputs, such as keys on the keyboard and mouse click, shall behave as specified in the requirement. If they are not specified, they shall do nothing when being pressed.
Images loaded onto screen shall appear without disfiguration. 

*Reliability*

The user should be able to run the program on a Windows or Mac OSX operating consistently. 
The user should expect the simulation to run each time upon loading
Crashes due to the software bugs should be minimized.

*Robustness*

If program crashes, the program shall restart from beginning

*Verifiability*
All major use cases must be regression tested.
100% of the user requirements must be measureable.

*Usability*

The programâ€™s UI and control shall be simple/straight forward so that it is easily understood by the user (user-friendly).
User shall be able to double clicked on the .exe file to run the program.
User shall be able to install and operate the program without assistance of any kind or major technical skills.

*Performance*

The program shall not take longer than 3 minutes during an average loading process.
Any sort of command received from the user shall not take longer than 10 seconds to execute.
The user should be able to walk around the world smoothly and see 3D animals, plants, and buildings on every run.

*Maintainability*

The application does not need to be maintained. Future up

*Portability*

The program shall be able to run on Windows and Mac OSX operating system.

*Understandability*

Any user that has knowledge of how to run an application should be able to run this program.
Users shall be able to operate the program without outside assistance.  

*Reusability*

Components/Assets created in this application can be reused or modified in any Unity3D project.
This application can be easily adapted into games or different applications.
